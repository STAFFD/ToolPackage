A block of unknown material is weighed and the mass is determined. The block is then tested in a calorimetry experiment. In this experiment the block is placed in a thermal reservoir. The block's temperature increases, until it reaches the thermal reservoir's temperature. The amount of heat required to bring the block to the reservoir's temperature is recorded. This is repeated with thermal reservoirs of different temperature. The block's change in temperature is also recorded.

 

Plot Q vs ΔT, including units and labels. Find the block's specific heat from the plot created. Determine the block's material by comparing the experimental specific heat to a table of known specific heats: Link.Links to an external site.

Note: Refer to the second column in the link's table, which has units of 𝐽𝑔𝐾.

The thermometer on an industrial furnace is inaccurate. To determine the temperature a tungsten ball was placed in the furnace, until the ball reached the furnace's temperature. The ball was then immediately placed into water. The temperature of the water (with the ball placed inside), was recorded. Determine the temperature of the furnace in Celsius to the nearest degree. 


The tungsten ball has a mass of m = 62 g and a specific heat of c = 0.134 𝐽𝑔⋅𝐾. The water has a mass of m = 100 g and a specific heat of c = 4.186 𝐽𝑔⋅𝐾. The Temperature vs Time plot is shown below. Determine the temperature of the furnace.
